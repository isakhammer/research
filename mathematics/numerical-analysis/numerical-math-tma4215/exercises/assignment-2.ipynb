    "# TMA4215 - Assignment 2 - Conjugate Gradient and ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline:** Wednesday September 23, 11:59PM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method.\n",
    "Then there are some small theoretical questions on Numerical ODEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PCG algorithm.** Implementations of the (P)CG algorithm can be found in many libraries, but here you are supposed to implement your own code for solving $Ax=b$ by PCG. Here we shall assume that the matrix $A$ is implemented by means of a function, say *A_func(v)* that for any vector $v$ returns $Av$. Similarly, we implement the preconditioner also as a function *Precond(v)* that returns $P^{-1}v$ for any vector $v$. An popular alternative to this approach is to use sparse representation of matrices, (see e.g. *scipy.sparse*), but we shall not use that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are of course allowed to use the obvious built-in functions for elementary operations, such as computing inner products, norms etc. We will provide the function *A_func(v)* to be used in this assignment. Your job is to implement a function *PCG* whose template you find below, a function *Precond(v)* that implements some iterations of the Gauss-Jacobi splitting method as preconditioner, and finally a small main programme that generates the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 1.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** Fill in the templates below for a function *PCG* \n",
    "\n",
    "*PCG* should take 5 input arguments, \n",
    "1. the function *A_func* that takes $v$ as input and returns $A\\cdot v$.\n",
    "2. the right hand side *b* of the system $A\\cdot x = b$ (numpy array)\n",
    "3. The initial guess *x0*\n",
    "4. *tol*, a tolerance used to define the stopping criterion\n",
    "5. *Precond* which is a function that takes a vector $v$ as input and returns $P^{-1}v$ for the preconditioner $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There should be 3 output arguments: \n",
    "1. the computed solution $x$, \n",
    "2. the residual after the last iteration, $r$ \n",
    "3. the number of iterations *iter* needed to meet the stopping criterion \n",
    "\n",
    "The stopping criterion can be taken as ($\\|r\\|<$*tol* or *iter*$\\geq N$) where $N$ is the dimension of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Write a Gauss-Jacobi preconditioner function (see below *PrecJac*)\n",
    "Test your implementation using the supplied function *A_func* which takes as input a vector $v\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ and returns the vector in $A\\cdot v\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. This corresponds to a discretisation of the Poisson equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ -\\nabla^2 u = f $$\n",
    "\n",
    "in the plane, so that there are $n$ discretisation points in each direction, thereby dimension $n^2$ of the unknown solution vector. You can take *x0* to be the 0-vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. The right hand side is also obtained by a supplied function *b_def* (see below) that from an input integer $n$ returns a vector $b\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*PrecJac(v)*. This function can be considered as tailored for the example given by *A_func*.\n",
    "Starting with the 0-vector as initial guess, apply a specified number of iterations with the Gauss-Jacobi iterative method to the problem $Au=v$. The number of iterations can be specified in the main program. \n",
    "You need the diagonal of $A$ to construct the preconditioner and you can assume that $M=\\text{diag}(A)=4I$ (four times the identity matrix). Therefore, via $A=M-N$ in Gauss-Jacobi, you can write $N=M-A=4I-A$ so that the GJ-iteration becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "     u^{(k+1)} = M^{-1}N u^{k} + M^{-1}b = (I-\\frac14 A)u^{(k)}+\\frac 14 b = u^{(k)}+\\frac14 (b-Au^{(k)}),\\quad\n",
    "     u^{(0)} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to run the program with and without preconditioner for $N=n^2, \\ n=20, 40, 60, \\ldots, 200$. For each $n$, print out a line with $n$, *iterNull* and *iterJac2*, and *iterJac4*. Here *iterNull* is without preconditoning,\n",
    "*iterJac2* and *iterJac4* is with 2 and 4 Gauss-Jacobi iterations respectively.\n",

    "You can use *tol*$=10^{-5}$ in all experiments. Always let *x0* be the zero-vector.\n",
