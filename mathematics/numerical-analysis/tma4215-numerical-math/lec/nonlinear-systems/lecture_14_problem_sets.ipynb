    "## Polynomial Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $n$ (distinct) node points $\\{x_0,\\ldots,x_n\\} \\in [a,b]$ and some function $f:[a,b] \\to \\mathbb R$, we defined the interpolation polynomial as the polynomial $p_n \\in \\mathcal P_n$ ($\\mathcal P_n$ denotes the space of polynomials of degree $\\leq n$) which satisfy\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(x_i) = f(x_i), \\quad i=0,\\ldots,n. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will write this as $p(f \\mid x_0, \\ldots, x_n)$. \n",

    "### Lagrange Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from last time, that using the Lagrange polynomials \n",

    "#### Adding Data Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Now assume that we want to add a new data point $(x_{n+1},y_{n+1})$. Observe that the Lagrange polynomials $l_i$ depend on every data point $x_j$, including the new point $x_{n+1}$. This means that we must reconstruct all the Lagrange polynomials in order to interpolate the new point $(x_{n+1},y_{n+1})$. The question is whether we can use another basis for $\\mathcal P_n$ such that we do not need to reconstruct all the basis polynomials when adding a new point?\n",
