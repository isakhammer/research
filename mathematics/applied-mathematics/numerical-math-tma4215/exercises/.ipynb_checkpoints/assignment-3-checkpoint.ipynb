    "With reference to the lectures and section 11.7 in the book (see in particular Example 11.8 on page 514) you shall implement the method as in *PECE* mode with constant step size. You need a starting method for the first step. You may also need a completion method for the last step. For this you will use the second order explicit two-stage Runge-Kutta method known as improved Euler (other names are Heun's method or explicit trapeziodal method). \n",

    "**Control question 1.** Using ABM2(LV,y0,t0,T,h) where $y_0=[2,1]^T$, $t_0=0$, $T=2$, $h=0.03$, what is the resulting approximation to $u(2)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** You will now learn a very standard method for estimating the convergence order of the method. This is actually a great code verification tool when you are writing software for solving ODEs. We explain it in steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let $T$ be the final time in which you want to test (the order of) the method on a given problem.\n",
    "2. Compute a reference solution at $t=T$, i.e. an approximation *yexact* of high accuracy to the solution at $t=T$. This can be done in different ways. One is to make a call to a builtin function with strict tolerances, e.g. *scipy.integrate* seems to contain several solvers. Another option is to write a simple solver with good accuracy, you could do for instance the standard four stage fourth order Runge-Kutta method. To save you some work, we offer a simple implementation of this method below (RK4) that you can use if you prefer. The important thing with the reference solution is that it is accurate enough to estimate the smallest error in your test.\n",
    "3. Now, take a suitable range of log-spaced stepsizes. For our problem here, a first attempt could be to set\n",
    "*HH=numpy.logspace(-4,-1,20)* that gives you a numpy-array of 20 stepsizes log-spaced between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-1}$.\n",
    "4. Run the method/implementation you want to test for all these stepsizes up to time $t=T$. For each stepsize $h$ in *HH* , compute  $\\|y_T(h)-y_{ex}\\|$ where $y_T(h)$ is your approximation at $t=T$ for this stepsize, and $y_{ex}$ is the reference solution *yexact*. Store these values in a numpy-array *err.\n",
    "5. Now make a loglog-plot of *err* vs *HH*. If the error behaves like $C h^p$ this should give a straight line of slope $p$ in the loglog-plot.\n",
    "6. Estimate the order as numbers. Since our hypothesis is that for a stepsize $h_i$, the corresponding error is of the form $\\mathrm{err}_i \\approx Ch_i^{p}$, we can estimate $p$ from two stepsizes $h_1$ and $h_2$.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{err}_i \\approx Ch_i^{p},\\ i=1,2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad p \\approx \\frac{\\log\\frac{\\mathrm{err}_1}{\\mathrm{err}_2}}{\\log\\frac{h_1}{h_2}}\n",

    "You can compute this expression for every consecutive pair of stepsizes $(h_i, h_{i+1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Jupyter Notebook, please implement this order test for the Lotka-Volterra problem to estimate the order of the ABM2 method. In the test, use the LV-function from **(b)**, set $y_0=[2,1]^T$, $t_0=0$, $T=10$ and use stepsizes logspaced in the range $10^{-4},\\ldots,10^{-1}$.\n",
